# üìß Email Spam Classifier with Multiple ML Models

This project is a machine learning-based system for classifying email messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It compares multiple algorithms using performance metrics and visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and bar charts for accuracy, F1 score, and AUC.

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset used is [`spam.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from the UCI SMS Spam Collection. It contains two columns:
- `label`: `ham` or `spam`
- `text`: the email/SMS content
